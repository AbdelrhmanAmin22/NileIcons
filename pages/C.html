            <h2>Command & control</h2>
            <p>The Historical origin of the
                command and control meaning in
                technology came from the wars on
                battlefields when the right decision
                maker was the one who could see
                the big picture from all angles, leave
                nothing in the shadows, and
                communicate in real-time with his
                leaders to efficiently, fully utilize
                and manage all his resources for the
                right action. This enables a safe risk
                analysis which is a major factor in
                taking the element of surprise
                under control.
